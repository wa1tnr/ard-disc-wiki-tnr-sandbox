# What is Programming?

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

*Programming* is a means to tell a computer (or, in the case of
the Arduino, a *microcontroller*) what to do, when to do it and how
to do it, and if to keep on doing it 'forever' or for an amount of
time, or (yup, there's more options) &hellip; until some resource
it needs (to keep running) has been completely used up.

#### Scenario: potato-chip counting machine

*You want to build a machine that counts potato chips in your potato
chip factory.  It's a task well-suited to industrial microcontrollers,
which are smallish devices that often fit in the palm of your hand,
for just the microcontroller 'chip' itself.*

*A microcontroller is just another type of computer chip, but its
specialty is dealing with the real world, through 'mechatronics'
(electro-mechanical devices and other machinery that can accept
instructions via wires &hellip; or, in the modern day, via
wireless links).*


# What, then, is Programming?

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Introduction for Beginners: What is a Computer Language?

From Leo Brodie:

[Starting Forth: Introductions](
https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/)

> At first when beginners hear the term “computer language,” they
wonder, “What kind of language could a computer possibly speak? It
must be awfully hard for people to understand. It probably looks like:

> > `976#!@NX714&+`

> if it looks like anything at all.

> Actually a computer language should not be difficult to understand.
Its purpose is simply to serve as a convenient compromise for
communication between a person and a computer.

 - - -

So, looking at it from Leo's point of view, *programming* is a way to
talk to a computer.  Even the word, 'talk' is misused here&mdash;*they
had to start somewhere*.  There are many *borrow-words* used in
*programming*, taken from the learner's native (spoken and written;
human; pre-computer) language.

#### Nuts and Bolts of Programs

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The microcontroller (`MCU`) chip itself accepts a long series of
`1's and 0's` (ones and zeros) as its only means of communication
(excepting analog, but that's another talk show).

The *machine code* is just those `1's and 0's` and doesn't need further
support to function.

*Assembly Language* is simply using those very same `1's and 0's`,
but with a cheater lookup table, so that you could use made-up words
to represent frequently used patterns of `1's and 0's` in your
new 'program'.

*Machine code* can be programmed using just front panel switches.
Nothing else!

*Assembler (assembly language)* would require you to use some
kind of a typewriter&mdash;or other keyboard-like device&mdash;so
that you could use some kind of *language*&mdash;made-up, or
borrowed from someone else&mdash;to 'talk' to the microcontroller,
and give it *instructions on what to do*.

And when to do it.  How to do it!  When not to do it.  And, maybe,
special instructions on what should be done if your *assumptions
were incorrect*. ;)


```cpp
// #include <Arduino.h> // optional

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
    delay(2200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}
```

#### Ok but this got complicated, fast

Yeah, it did. ;)

Here's a wokwi 'answer' to some of that:

[*Misuse of C Preprocessor to simplify code*](https://wokwi.com/projects/346588077549945428)
**morse_beacon.ino** *on wokwi*

That lets you cheat, quite a bit. ;)


> *Disclaimer: the above cheat comes directly from experience in 'Forth' programming (it's another programming language).  Forth programmers often resort to the C Preprocessor to coerce C++ program syntax&hellip; really, quite a bit. ;)*

> *You're not 'supposed to' do this&mdash;there's a strong feeling about this, about.  Just be aware of it; it's a large detour from C++ itself, which is the 'Language of Arduino' so to speak.*

# Massive skipping of details&hellip;
## TODO - missing details



## Tools, not Rules

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Top down, bottom up, middle out

So, the above program already *works*.  Here's a way to look at how
it got made (see just below).

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
void setup() { } void loop() {} // END.
```

This program compiles and 'runs' just fine, on wowki.  Doesn't do
much; isn't meant to.

In a sense, it has several *placeholders* for *future ideas* that
were not (yet) typed into the computer (using some kind of
*code editor* or just a *plaintext* editor).


> *If you leave a placeholder in, 'permanently', you have just
> created a* **hook**.  *Do not put in hooks.  Ever.  Create them
> as required.*

> *If you must, revision control has tools to help you remember
> how to add the hook, when it is truly wanted.*

**The above is opinion, and isn't to be followed; unless you agree
to it by your own philosophy.** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;)


`/netreligion`


`Top-down, bottom-up, middle-out` is an approach to programming; it
surely has an accepted definition and description, but will be used
here, only informally, to describe what the theory books will talk
about in detail, using proper names for everything. ;)

It's a tool.  You can use it, or fall back on your other skills and
completely ignore it.  *Everyone develops a style of their own*.

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Slightly more formal - same exact program; just added some spacing
to make it a bit easier to take in, while reading it over.*


```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Initialize the Serial stuph.*

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() { }

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Add a placeholder function called `haha()` that will (later on)
contain something interesting to do, after starting the Serial going
(which lets you print stuph out).*


```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println(" TEST abciq "); // weird message to recognize as ours
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Make `haha()` do something slightly interesting.*

### Then test it.

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void haha_old_delete_me() { // cruft
    Serial.println(" TEST abciq "); // weird message
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

So the program's 'working'.  People say that a
lot:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"It's working."* &nbsp;&nbsp;;)

Better: It compiles.  It mostly does what was expected.  Does at
least something useful.  Doesn't quite do what was in mind when
it was first *edited as code*.


```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

#if 0
void haha_old_delete_me() { // cruft
    Serial.priantln(" TEST abciq "); // weird message
}
#endif

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Show a method for commenting-out code that does not spoil syntax
highlighting inside the commented code.*

Note that `Serial.priantln("message"):` is deliberately misspelled,
but still 'compiles clean'.

*That was a test of the `#if 0` &hellip; `#endif`
construct.* &nbsp;&nbsp;;)


```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Code clean-up - the commented code is no longer operative
and is removed.  Don't worry, with revision control, it is
easily recalled, as required.*

```cpp
// - - -  CODE SNIPPET - - - DOES NOT COMPILE - - -

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
    delay(2200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}
```

This is really what's left to be done; *taken from the working
program; scroll up to see it.*


```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}

// END.
```

*Now the loop is 'playing'.  It's got stuph inside of it.
And it does it, whatever is in there, repeatedly.*


```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
    delay(2200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}

// END.
```

*A slight refinement: there's a decently long delay after
the `haha()` message plays, marking distinctly where the
`setup()` and and where the `loop()` begins, without
crudding it up with a `Mr. Obvious` announcement such as
`You are entering the loop!`*

(Scroll for discussion)

`The code:`

// Fri 28 Oct 16:03:11 UTC 2022

  Serial.print(ON_TIME);
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(OFF_TIME);
  Serial.println("");
}


void LED_BLINK () {
  LED_ON();
  delay(ON_TIME);
  LED_OFF();
  delay(OFF_TIME);
}

void setup_GPIO() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  LED_OFF();
}

void setup_serial() {

}

void setup() {
  setup_GPIO();
  setup_serial();
  report();
}

void loop() {

}

// END.
```
### Blink with Weight - first simplification

*Can you simplify that, slightly?*

Sure:


```
 $ cpp ./code.cpp > preprocessed-code.cpp
 $ cat ./preprocessed-code.cpp
```

```cpp
void LED_ON() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
}

void LED_OFF() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
}

void report() {
  Serial.println("\n The red LED is marked 'L' on the Uno.");
  Serial.println(" This program makes it blink.");

  Serial.print("\n Your ON_TIME: ");
  Serial.print((4 * 50));
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(((4 * 50) * 5));
  Serial.println("");
}

void LED_BLINK () {
  LED_ON();
  delay((4 * 50));
  LED_OFF();
  delay(((4 * 50) * 5));
}

void setup_GPIO() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  LED_OFF();
}

void setup_serial() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void setup() {
  setup_GPIO();
  setup_serial();
  report();
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```

### Blink with Weight - first simplification - discussion

*You said it was simpler, but there's new stuff now!*

Yeah.

The **C Preprocessor** was used to 'process' all the `#define` stuff.

What it does is **substitute** what you would have typed by hand if
you had never used a `#define` at all (for this use; there are other
interesting uses for a `#define` that are different from this use!)

In this case, the original `#define statements, some of them, were
not simple substitutions of number.  Instead, they substituted
multiplications, with the parentheses, and 'typed them into' the
main program text, exactly as you could have done yourself, by hand.

The C Preprocessor did not simplify further, so all the parentheses
are intact.

You can simplify further on your own, if you want simpler, hard-
coded numbers where the multiplications went.

That'll be next:


**Factor - remove determinant math**

```cpp
void LED_ON() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
}

void LED_OFF() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
}

void report() {
  Serial.println("\n The red LED is marked 'L' on the Uno.");
  Serial.println(" This program makes it blink.");

  Serial.print("\n Your ON_TIME: ");
  Serial.print(200);    // 4 * 50 = 200
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(1000); // 4 * 50 * 5 = 1000
  Serial.println("");
}

void LED_BLINK () {
  LED_ON();
  delay(200);  // 4 * 50 = 200
  LED_OFF();
  delay(1000); // 4 * 50 * 5 = 1000
}

void setup_GPIO() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  LED_OFF();
}

void setup_serial() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void setup() {
  setup_GPIO();
  setup_serial();
  report();
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```

*It's a bit simpler, now.*

**What changed: second simplification of Blink with Weight**

 * The C Preprocessor directives are gone (no more `#define`)
 * The math inside the parentheses was done by hand, and the results were substituted

**What was lost in the process of simplification**
 * The individual numbers that make up the math had real value, to change timing of the LED `blink/dark` cycle.
 * Those timings were distinct and could be easiy changed when they were still part of the `#define` statements; that ease of use/change/experimentation is no longer as evident.


#### Third simplification - Blink with Weight

**Compress the code - LED_BLINK() - i**

```cpp
void xxxLED_ON() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
}

void xxxLED_OFF() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
}

void report() {
  Serial.println("\n The red LED is marked 'L' on the Uno.");
  Serial.println(" This program makes it blink.");

  Serial.print("\n Your ON_TIME: ");
  Serial.print(200);    // 4 * 50 = 200
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(1000); // 4 * 50 * 5 = 1000
  Serial.println("");
}

void LED_BLINK () {
  // LED_ON();
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
  delay(200);  // 4 * 50 = 200
  // LED_OFF();
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
  delay(1000); // 4 * 50 * 5 = 1000
}

void setup_GPIO() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  // LED_OFF();
}

void setup_serial() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void setup() {
  setup_GPIO();
  setup_serial();
  report();
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```

#### Remove the commented code and comment out the unused functions

**Compress the code - LED_BLINK() - ii**

```cpp
// void xxxLED_ON() {
  // digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
// }

// void xxxLED_OFF() {
  // digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
// }

void report() {
  Serial.println("\n The red LED is marked 'L' on the Uno.");
  Serial.println(" This program makes it blink.");

  Serial.print("\n Your ON_TIME: ");
  Serial.print(200);
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(1000);
  Serial.println("");
}

void LED_BLINK () {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
  delay(1000);
}

void setup_GPIO() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void setup_serial() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void setup() {
  setup_GPIO();
  setup_serial();
  report();
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```

*Good.  Still runs exactly the same; code is a bit 'simpler' now.*

*Not necessarily 'better' but it is simpler!*




#### Cram it all into setup() where it was split out into functions

**Compress the code - LED_BLINK() - ii**

```cpp
void LED_BLINK () {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
  delay(1000);
}

void setup() {
  // setup_GPIO();
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);

  // setup_serial();
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // report();
  Serial.println("\n The red LED is marked 'L' on the Uno.");
  Serial.println(" This program makes it blink.");

  Serial.print("\n Your ON_TIME: ");
  Serial.print(200);
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(1000);
  Serial.println("");
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```




#### Druids, man.

*Nope. ;)*

**Compress the code - LED_BLINK() - ii**

```cpp
void LED_BLINK () {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1); delay(200);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0); delay(1000);
}

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.print("\n ON: "); Serial.print(200);
  Serial.print("    OFF: "); Serial.println(1000);
  Serial.println("");
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```


*Made things a bit more compact; the essential LED blink rate and duty cycle are unchanged.*

*Note that the `delay()` statements were brought up to the
 same lines as the digitalWrite() statements, saving on
 some vertical space.  There was a lot of unused empty
 space, there, and the clarity of the code doesn't suffer
 much (if at all) to do it that way.*


#### Last simplification: no printing at all.

*Maybe you don't have printing working, anyway, and already
know enough without the printing statements.*

**Compress the code - LED_BLINK() - ii**

```cpp
void LED_blink () {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1); delay(200);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0); delay(1000);
}

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  LED_blink();
}
```

*Also renamed the LED_BLINK() function to get rid of the excess upper-case lettering.*

## Pseudocode

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### What's pseudocode?

*Pseudocode is code you write without obeying real syntax rules;
it's there for you, and is meant to remind you of something pretty
close to what you wanted to 'program into the microcontoller' at
some point (hopefully later today!)*

That's pretty much it: fake code that is meant to *model* what you
think should be *going on* in your *program* when it's either
*finished* or at least *completed, up to a certain point* in
its *development*.
