# What is Programming?

*Programming* is a means to tell a computer (or, in the case of
the Arduino, a *microcontroller*) what to do, when to do it and how
to do it, and if to keep on doing it 'forever' or for an amount of
time, or (yup, there's more options) &hellip; until some resource
it needs (to keep running) has been completely used up.

#### Scenario: potato-chip counting machine

*You want to build a machine that counts potato chips in your potato
chip factory.  It's a task well-suited to industrial microcontrollers,
which are smallish devices that often fit in the palm of your hand,
for just the microcontroller 'chip' itself.*

*A microcontroller is just another type of computer chip, but its
specialty is dealing with the real world, through 'mechatronics'
(electro-mechanical devices and other machinery that can accept
instructions via wires &hellip; or, in the modern day, via
wireless links).*


# What, then, is Programming?
#### Introduction for Beginners: What is a Computer Language?

From Leo Brodie:

[Starting Forth: Introductions](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/)

> At first when beginners hear the term “computer language,” they wonder, “What kind of language could a computer possibly speak? It must be awfully hard for people to understand. It probably looks like:

> > `976#!@NX714&+`

> if it looks like anything at all.

> Actually a computer language should not be difficult to understand. Its purpose is simply to serve as a convenient compromise for communication between a person and a computer.

So, looking at it from Leo's point of view, *programming* is a way to talk to a computer.  Even the word, 'talk' is misused here&mdash;*they had to start somewhere*&mdash;there are many *borrow-words* used in *programming* from the learner's native (spoken and written, human, pre-computer) language.
