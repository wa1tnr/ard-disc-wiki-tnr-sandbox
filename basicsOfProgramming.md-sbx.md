# What is Programming?

*Programming* is a means to tell a computer (or, in the case of the Arduino, a *microcontroller*) what to do, when to do it and how to do it, and if to keep on doing it 'forever' or for an amount of time, or (yup, there's more options) &hellip; until some resource it needs (to keep running) has been completely used up.

#### Scenario: potato-chip counting machine

*You want to build a machine that counts potato chips in your potato chip factory.  It's a task well-suited to industrial microcontrollers, which are smallish devices that often fit in the palm of your hand, for just the microcontroller 'chip' itself.*

*A microcontroller is just another type of computer chip, but its specialty is dealing with the real world, through 'mechatronics' (electro-mechanical devices and other machinery that can accept instructions via wires &hellip; or, in the modern day, via wireless links.*
