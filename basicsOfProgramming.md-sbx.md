# What is Programming?

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents "Table Of Contents")

*Programming* is a means to tell a computer (or, in the case of
the Arduino, a *microcontroller*) what to do, when to do it and how
to do it, and if to keep on doing it 'forever' or for an amount of
time, or (yup, there's more options) &hellip; until some resource
it needs (to keep running) has been completely used up.

#### Scenario: potato-chip counting machine

*You want to build a machine that counts potato chips in your potato
chip factory.  It's a task well-suited to industrial microcontrollers,
which are smallish devices that often fit in the palm of your hand,
for just the microcontroller 'chip' itself.*

*A microcontroller is just another type of computer chip, but its
specialty is dealing with the real world, through 'mechatronics'
(electro-mechanical devices and other machinery that can accept
instructions via wires &hellip; or, in the modern day, via
wireless links).*

*So you wire it all up&hellip; your potato-chip counting
machine&hellip; and start 'programming it'.*

*Programming&hellip; the microcontroller chip found soldered to the
target board (Arduino Uno, Leonardo, Mega2560&hellip; or
other board).*

*It'll be a chip with a part number, such as `32u4` or `328p` and
usually has branding included (`ATMega 328p`, `ATMega 32u4`) depending
on if it needs to be clarified, or if it's clear what chip is being
discussed.*

#### When you ask for help, include the model and part number

*"I have an Uno R3 (328p) and I can compile a simple program for it,
upload the program to the Uno, and it seems to run (prints messages
to the Serial Terminal, as expected).  But there's a problem&hellip;"*


# What, then, is Programming?

#### Introduction for Beginners: What is a Computer Language?

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents "Table Of Contents")

From Leo Brodie:

[Starting Forth: Introductions](
https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/)

> At first when beginners hear the term “computer language,” they
wonder, “What kind of language could a computer possibly speak? It
must be awfully hard for people to understand. It probably looks like:

> > `976#!@NX714&+`

> if it looks like anything at all.

> Actually a computer language should not be difficult to understand.
Its purpose is simply to serve as a convenient compromise for
communication between a person and a computer.

 - - -

So, looking at it from Leo's point of view, *programming* is a way to
talk to a computer.  Even the word, 'talk' is misused here&mdash;*they
had to start somewhere*.  There are many *borrow-words* used in
*programming*, taken from the learner's native (spoken and written;
human; pre-computer) language.

## Nuts and Bolts of Programs

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents "Table Of Contents")

The microcontroller (`MCU`) chip itself accepts a long series of
`1's and 0's` (ones and zeros) as its only means of communication
(excepting analog, but that's another talk show).

The *machine code* is just those `1's and 0's` and doesn't need further
support to function.

*Assembly Language* is simply using those very same `1's and 0's`,
but with a cheater lookup table, so that you could use made-up words
to represent frequently used patterns of `1's and 0's` in your
new 'program'.

*Machine code* can be programmed using just front panel switches.
Nothing else!

*Assembler (assembly language)* would require you to use some
kind of a typewriter&mdash;or other keyboard-like device&mdash;so
that you could use some kind of *language*&mdash;made-up, or
borrowed from someone else&mdash;to 'talk' to the microcontroller,
and give it *instructions on what to do*.

And when to do it.  How to do it!  When not to do it.  And, maybe,
special instructions on what should be done if your *assumptions
were incorrect*. ;)

### Grateful program

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents "Table Of Contents")

**This is what a simple program might look like, in the** ***Arduino IDE*** **:**

```cpp
// #include <Arduino.h> // optional

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
    delay(2200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}
```

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents "Table Of Contents")

Yeah, it did. ;)

Here's a wokwi 'answer' to some of that:

[*Misuse of C Preprocessor to simplify code*](

**morse_beacon.ino** *on wokwi*

That lets you cheat, quite a bit. ;)


> *Disclaimer: the above cheat comes directly from experience in
'Forth' programming (it's another programming language).  Forth
programmers often resort to the C Preprocessor to coerce C++ program
syntax&hellip; really, quite a bit. ;)*

> *You're not 'supposed to' do this&mdash;there's a strong feeling
about this, about.  Just be aware of it; it's a large detour from
C++ itself, which is the 'Language of Arduino' so to speak.*

## The C++ Language is the language used in the Arduino IDE

There's a 'computer language' called `C++` that is used in the
Arduino IDE, similarly to how `C++` is used on your desktop PC.

Most of what's in this document (the one you're reading right
now) uses `code examples` written for the Arduino IDE, using
specifics of the 'Arduino Language' as it were.

You can take a look here, for some of the basics of that language:

## Tools, not Rules

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

### Top down, bottom up, middle out

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

So, the above program already *works*.  Here's a way to look at how
it got made (see just below).

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
void setup() { } void loop() {} // END.
```

This program compiles and 'runs' just fine, on wowki.  Doesn't do
much; isn't meant to.

In a sense, it has several *placeholders* for *future ideas* that
were not (yet) typed into the computer (using some kind of
*code editor* or just a *plaintext* editor).


> *If you leave a placeholder in, 'permanently', you have just
> created a* **hook**.  *Do not put in hooks.  Ever.  Create them
> as required.*

> *If you must, revision control has tools to help you remember
> how to add the hook, when it is truly wanted.*

**The above is opinion, and isn't to be followed; unless you agree
to it by your own philosophy.** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;)


`/netreligion`


`Top-down, bottom-up, middle-out` is an approach to programming; it
surely has an accepted definition and description, but will be used
here, only informally, to describe what the theory books will talk
about in detail, using proper names for everything. ;)

It's a tool.  You can use it, or fall back on your other skills and
completely ignore it.  *Everyone develops a style of their own*.

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Slightly more formal - same exact program; just added some spacing
to make it a bit easier to take in, while reading it over.*

### Initialize the Serial stuph

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

### Add a placeholder function called `haha()`

&hellip; that will (later on) contain something interesting to do,
after starting the Serial going (which lets you print stuph out).

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() { }

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

### Make `haha()` do something slightly interesting. Then test it

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")


```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println(" TEST abciq "); // weird message to recognize as ours
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

### It's working

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void haha_old_delete_me() { // cruft
    Serial.println(" TEST abciq "); // weird message
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

So the program's 'working'.  People say that a
lot:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"It's working."* &nbsp;&nbsp;;)

**Better:** It compiles.  It mostly does what was expected.  Does at
least something useful.  Doesn't quite do what was in mind when
it was first *edited as code*.


### Comment out unused code

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

#if 0
void haha_old_delete_me() { // cruft
    Serial.priantln(" TEST abciq "); // weird message
}
#endif

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Shows a method for commenting-out code that does not spoil syntax
highlighting inside the commented code.*

Note that `Serial.priantln("message");` is deliberately misspelled,
but still 'compiles clean'.

*That was a test of the `#if 0` &hellip; `#endif`
construct.* &nbsp;&nbsp;;)


### Strip out commented code entirely

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
}

// END.
```

*Code clean-up - the commented code is no longer operative
and is removed.  Don't worry, with revision control, it is
easily recalled, as required.*

### What still remains to be done - snippet

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp
// - - -  CODE SNIPPET - - - DOES NOT COMPILE - - -

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
    delay(2200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}
```

This is really what's left to be done; *taken from the working
program; scroll up to see it.*


### Add the repeating code to the loop

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}

// END.
```

*Now the loop is 'playing'.  It's got stuph inside of it.
And it does it, whatever is in there, repeatedly.*


### Fixup the `setup()` to separate events

[Table of Contents](#toc-tools-not-rules "Table Of Contents")

```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
    delay(2200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}

// END.
```

*A slight refinement: there's a decently long delay after
the `haha()` message plays, marking distinctly where the
`setup()` and and where the `loop()` begins, without
crudding it up with a `Mr. Obvious` announcement such as
`You are entering the loop!`*

### Blink with Weight - first simplification

[Table of Contents](#toc-blink-with-weight "Table Of Contents")

*Can you simplify that, slightly?*

Sure:


```
 $ cpp ./code.cpp > preprocessed-code.cpp
 $ cat ./preprocessed-code.cpp
```

```cpp
void LED_ON() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
}

void LED_OFF() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
}

void report() {
  Serial.println("\n The red LED is marked 'L' on the Uno.");
  Serial.println(" This program makes it blink.");

  Serial.print("\n Your ON_TIME: ");
  Serial.print((4 * 50));
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(((4 * 50) * 5));
  Serial.println("");
}

void LED_BLINK () {
  LED_ON();
  delay((4 * 50));
  LED_OFF();
  delay(((4 * 50) * 5));
}

void setup_GPIO() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  LED_OFF();
}

void setup_serial() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void setup() {
  setup_GPIO();
  setup_serial();
  report();
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```

### Blink with Weight - first simplification - discussion

[Table of Contents](#toc-blink-with-weight "Table Of Contents")

*You said it was simpler, but there's new stuff now!*

Yeah.

The **C Preprocessor** was used to 'process' all the `#define` stuff.

What it does is **substitute** what you would have typed by hand if
you had never used a `#define` at all (for this use; there are other
interesting uses for a `#define` that are different from this use!)

In this case, the original `#define` statements, some of them, were
not simple substitutions of number.  Instead, they substituted
multiplications, with the parentheses, and 'typed them into' the
main program text, exactly as you could have done yourself, by hand.

The C Preprocessor did not simplify further, so all the parentheses
are intact.

You can simplify further on your own, if you want simpler, hard-
coded numbers where the multiplications went.

That'll be next:


### Factor - remove determinant math

[Table of Contents](#toc-blink-with-weight "Table Of Contents")

```cpp
void LED_ON() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
}

void LED_OFF() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
}

void report() {
  Serial.println("\n The red LED is marked 'L' on the Uno.");
  Serial.println(" This program makes it blink.");

  Serial.print("\n Your ON_TIME: ");
  Serial.print(200);    // 4 * 50 = 200
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(1000); // 4 * 50 * 5 = 1000
  Serial.println("");
}

void LED_BLINK () {
  LED_ON();
  delay(200);  // 4 * 50 = 200
  LED_OFF();
  delay(1000); // 4 * 50 * 5 = 1000
}

void setup_GPIO() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  LED_OFF();
}

void setup_serial() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void setup() {
  setup_GPIO();
  setup_serial();
  report();
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```

*It's a bit simpler, now.*

#### What changed: second simplification of Blink with Weight

[Table of Contents](#toc-blink-with-weight "Table Of Contents")

 * The C Preprocessor directives are gone (no more `#define`)
 * The math inside the parentheses was done by hand, and the results
   were substituted

#### What was lost in the process of simplification

[Table of Contents](#toc-blink-with-weight "Table Of Contents")

 * The individual numbers that make up the math had real value, to
   change timing of the LED `blink/dark` cycle.
 * Those timings were distinct and could be easiy changed when they
   were still part of the `#define` statements; that ease of
   use/change/experimentation is no longer as evident.

### Third simplification - Blink with Weight

[Table of Contents](#toc-blink-with-weight "Table Of Contents")

**Compress the code - LED_BLINK() - i**

// END.

### Remove the commented code and comment out the unused functions

[Table of Contents](#toc-blink-with-weight "Table Of Contents")

**Compress the code - LED_BLINK() - ii**

```cpp
// void xxxLED_ON() {
  // digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
// }

// void xxxLED_OFF() {
  // digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
// }

void report() {
  Serial.println("\n The red LED is marked 'L' on the Uno.");
  Serial.println(" This program makes it blink.");

  Serial.print("\n Your ON_TIME: ");
  Serial.print(200);
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(1000);
  Serial.println("");
}

void LED_BLINK () {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);

}

void setup() {
  setup_GPIO();
  setup_serial();
  report();
}

void loop() {

}
// END.
```

*Good.  Still runs exactly the same; code is a bit 'simpler' now.*

*Not necessarily 'better' but it is simpler!*


### Cram it all into setup() where it was split out into functions

[Table of Contents](#toc-blink-with-weight "Table Of Contents")

  Serial.print(200);
  Serial.print("    Your OFF_TIME: ");
  Serial.println(1000);
  Serial.println("");
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```


### Druids, man.

[Table of Contents](#toc-adruids-man "Table Of Contents")

*Nope. ;)*

**Compress the code - setup() - ii**

```cpp
void LED_BLINK () {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1); delay(200);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0); delay(1000);
}

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.print("\n ON: "); Serial.print(200);
  Serial.print("    OFF: "); Serial.println(1000);
  Serial.println("");
}

void loop() {
  LED_BLINK();
}
// END.
```

*Made things a bit more compact; the essential LED blink rate and
duty cycle are unchanged.*

`report()` remnants greatly reduced or compressed to simpler
information printed.

*Note that the `delay()` statements were brought up to the same
lines as the `digitalWrite()` statements, saving on some vertical
space.  There was a lot of unused empty space, there, and the
clarity of the code doesn't suffer much (if at all) to do it
that way.*


### Last simplification: no printing at all.

[Table of Contents](#toc-adruids-man "Table Of Contents")

*Maybe you don't have printing working, anyway, and already
know enough without the printing statements.*

**Compress the code - no printing at all**

```cpp
void LED_blink () {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1); delay(200);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0); delay(1000);
}

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  LED_blink();
}
```

*Also renamed the LED_BLINK() function to get rid of the excess
upper-case lettering.*


### Wait wait can't you just shove it in the loop?

[Table of Contents](#toc-adruids-man "Table Of Contents")

*You're right!  Missed that simplification. ;*

**Compress the code - everything inside the loop()**

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1); delay(200);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0); delay(1000);
}
```


### Okay that was a bit too stingy, what about making it look nice, again?

[Table of Contents](#toc-adruids-man "Table Of Contents")

*Good idea.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Compress the code - reformat for clarity
and simplicity**

```cpp
void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 1);
    delay(200);

    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, 0);
    delay(1000);
}
```

**That's kinda nice now!**

Indeed.

## Pseudocode

[Table of Contents](#toc-adruids-man "Table Of Contents")

#### What's pseudocode?

*Pseudocode is code you write without obeying real syntax rules;
it's there for you, and is meant to remind you of something pretty
close to what you wanted to 'program into the microcontroller' at
some point (hopefully later today!)*

That's pretty much it: fake code that is meant to *model* what you
think should be *going on* in your *program* when it's either
*finished* or at least *completed, up to a certain point* in
its *development*.
