# What is Programming?

*Programming* is a means to tell a computer (or, in the case of
the Arduino, a *microcontroller*) what to do, when to do it and how
to do it, and if to keep on doing it 'forever' or for an amount of
time, or (yup, there's more options) &hellip; until some resource
it needs (to keep running) has been completely used up.

#### Scenario: potato-chip counting machine

*You want to build a machine that counts potato chips in your potato
chip factory.  It's a task well-suited to industrial microcontrollers,
which are smallish devices that often fit in the palm of your hand,
for just the microcontroller 'chip' itself.*

  &#123;summary>More (*microcontroller, defined*)</summary>
*A microcontroller is just another type of computer chip, but its
specialty is dealing with the real world, through 'mechatronics'
(electro-mechanical devices and other machinery that can accept
instructions via wires &hellip; or, in the modern day, via
wireless links.*
