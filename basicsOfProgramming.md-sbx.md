# What is Programming?

*Programming* is a means to tell a computer (or, in the case of
the Arduino, a *microcontroller*) what to do, when to do it and how
to do it, and if to keep on doing it 'forever' or for an amount of
time, or (yup, there's more options) &hellip; until some resource
it needs (to keep running) has been completely used up.

#### Scenario: potato-chip counting machine

*You want to build a machine that counts potato chips in your potato
chip factory.  It's a task well-suited to industrial microcontrollers,
which are smallish devices that often fit in the palm of your hand,
for just the microcontroller 'chip' itself.*

*A microcontroller is just another type of computer chip, but its
specialty is dealing with the real world, through 'mechatronics'
(electro-mechanical devices and other machinery that can accept
instructions via wires &hellip; or, in the modern day, via
wireless links).*


# What, then, is Programming?
#### Introduction for Beginners: What is a Computer Language?

From Leo Brodie:

[Starting Forth: Introductions](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/)

> At first when beginners hear the term “computer language,” they
wonder, “What kind of language could a computer possibly speak? It
must be awfully hard for people to understand. It probably looks like:

> > `976#!@NX714&+`

> if it looks like anything at all.

> Actually a computer language should not be difficult to understand.
Its purpose is simply to serve as a convenient compromise for
communication between a person and a computer.

So, looking at it from Leo's point of view, *programming* is a way to
talk to a computer.  Even the word, 'talk' is misused here&mdash;*they
had to start somewhere*.  There are many *borrow-words* used in
*programming*, taken from the learner's native (spoken and written;
human; pre-computer) language.

#### Nuts and Bolts of Programs

The microcontroller (`MCU`) chip itself accepts a long series of
`1's and 0's` (ones and zeros) as its only means of communication
(excepting analog, but that's another talk show).

The *microcode* is just those 1's and 0's and doesn't need further
support to function.

*Assembly Language* is simply using those very same `1's and 0's`,
but with a cheater lookup table, so that you could use made-up words
to represent frequently used patterns of `1's and 0's` in your
new 'program'.

*Microcode* can be programmed using just front panel switches.
Nothing else!

*Assembler* *(assembly language)* would require you to use some kind
of a typewriter&mdash;or other keyboard-like device&mdash;so that you
could use some kind of *language*&mdash;made-up, or borrowed from
someone else&mdash;to 'talk' to the microcontroller, and give it
*instructions on what to do*.

And when to do it.  How to do it!  When not to do it.  And, maybe,
special instructions on what should be done if your
*assumptions were incorrect*. ;)


```cpp
// #include <Arduino.h> // optional

void haha() {
    Serial.println("When I die,");
    Serial.println("Bury me deep;");
    Serial.println("Put two speakers at my feet.");
    Serial.println("Put some headphones on my head,");
    Serial.println(".. and always play the Grateful Dead.");
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    haha();
    delay(2200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println("   Always play the Grateful Dead.");
    delay(2200);
}
```
