# Arduino Buyers Guide  | [HOME](README.md) |

### This is a guide on all the different Arduino's

### The Arduino Uno is the most common Arduino because it has a normal amount of IO. Also, there is no need to solder.

### The Leonardo has the same form-factor as the Uno but can be used as a hid device, like a gamepad or "button-box" and such

### The Mega 2560 is extremely common. it has over three times IO then the UNO. If you need a lot of LEDs, or pins to use, the MEGA is a good choice for this

### The Micro is good to use on a breadboard and is compact this has the same chip as the Leonardo

### The Due also has a lot of IO, has more memory than the Mega 2560. This makes it a great starter board also

### The nano has the same chip as the Uno so can be used in a final product. Many times it's easiest to prototype on a UNO, then when all the debugging is done, use the NANO for the final product
